          <p class="longParagraph">In this project, the only permitted interaction devices are the Oculus Rift HMD and the two Touch controllers. Keyboard, mouse and other input devices cannot be used once the application runs. We were to enable physics so that the furniture sits on the floor and does not go through other furniture or walls. The primary task was to redesign the VR lab in room B210 - to write a 3D application which loads the 3D model of 
          the lab and displays it at 1:1 scale.</p>
          <p class = "longParagraph"> We covered the following techniques in lecture, and most of them are present in my project:
          <ol>
              <li class="longParagraph">Put the user in the lab and provide functionality to teleport from one location to another. To teleport, the user points 
                with one of the Touch controllers to a new location on the floor, to which the camera then switches.</li>
              <li class="longParagraph">Allow the spawning of the following items: desks, chairs, locker cabinets, storage cabinets, TVs on stands, and white boards 
                for the walls. You are free to offer more object types than above.</li>
              <li class="longParagraph">Implement an interaction technique to select any one of the items in the room (5 points) and move it to a new location. 
                Allow rotations of the furniture objects. The white boards should be movable along the walls only and not fall to the ground.
                All furniture must sit on the floor once placed.</li>
              <li class="longParagraph">Create a method to select any number of objects to group them together (5 points), highlight the selected items, then allow
                moving the group as a whole (5 points). This only makes sense between objects with the same degrees of movement freedom - i.e., 
                white boards should only group with other items on the same wall.</li>
              <li class="longParagraph">Create 'save' and 'load' functions to store the furniture configuration on disk and retrieve it at a later point. Group information does not need to get saved.</li>
              <li class="longParagraph">Create a room design with 26 desks, at least 30 lockers and two storage cabinets, which makes more sense to you than the current layout.</li>

          <p class="longParagraph">This project required the use of the Leapmotion sensor which we mounted onto the HMD of the Oculus Rift. We were no longer allowed
            to use the touch controllers to allow for extra functionality. The primary task was to write a 3D program that read an input file with 3D coordinates that 
            represented a race track. Once loaded, the following requirements were necessary: </p>    
          <ol>
              <li class="longParagraph">Flight Controls: Implement a way to fly continuously and can't instantaneously "teleport" anywhere at any time. When flying, 
                the user needs to be able to look around without impacting the direction in which s/he is flying or speed. The flight controls I opted for were to "grip" with the
                left hand to accelerate, and use the right palm to impact the rotation/pitch/roll of the player in flight. The distance at which the player held their hand from the 
                HMD affected how fast they would travel along the right hands orientation as well. 
              </li>
              <li class="longParagraph">Wayfinding: Come up with at least 2 different ways of finding the next checkpoint. We implemented a compass arrow that always points to the
                next checkpoint, along with thick lines drawn between each checkpoint to make obvious the track. 
              </li>
              <li class="longParagraph">Gameplay: The players aircraft should start at the first checkpoint, with zero pitch or roll. Use a countdown timer when starting the race, 
                and when the player hits the floor/building and it should reset the position of the player to the last checkpoint reached. When the last checkpoint is reached
                the race should end and a total time elapsed counter should be displayed to show the user how long it toom them to finish the track.

            <p class="longParagraph">I worked closely with the quality assurance (QA) and recieving inspection groups in order to evaluate the effectiveness of their current infrastructure of their departmental websites. I was able to determine that their current structure was outdated and needed a complete overhaul. I successfully united all the content of all of the QA group websites as well as localizing all of the static data into a central database using Coldfusion, SQL, Ajax, and jQuery.</p>
            <p class="longParagraph">This new redesign implemented the customization of content without the need of heavy HTML/CSS editing by incorporating tools to edit the HTML pages remotely. This was done to allow all content to be easily accessible and editable.</p>
            <p class="longParagraph">The consolidation of content also eliminated a lot of redudancy, which helped reduced non-value added time to the users who accessed the site. By having all of the groups sites under one main website gave the QA group a more cohesive, organized feel that made it more appealing to users.</p>
            <p class="longParagraph">Before ending my 10 week internship, I also realized some future improvements to my implementation including streamlined methods to integrate new technologies.</p>

            <p class="longParagraph">The goal of my project was to select and implement a state-of-the-art model to predict ship traffic patterns and detect anomalous vessel behavior using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. AIS is an automatic tracking system required on ships whose gross tonnage >= 300 tons.</p>
            <p class="longParagraph">An initial framework was necessary to construct a network of traffic routes. I was allowed the use of TREAD route management software to explore solutions to this project and all mathematical calculations and programming were conducted using MATLAB. </p>
            <p class="longParagraph">My idea was to apply the TREAD software to local AIS data to generate actual ship routes, then implement a state space model on those routes to see how accurately it can predict ship behavior.</p>
            <p class="longParagraph">This model relied heavily on the udnerlying idea of nodes (a point at which a major change in course is detected for a generated route and for a specific ship) which are used to construct a network of possible ship paths. The model detects the most likely set of segments and nodes an observed ship will travel (route prediction) and also large deviations from predicted positions (anomaly detection).</p>
